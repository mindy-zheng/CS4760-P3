# OS-3: Adding Message Queues to our System
-----------------------------------
In this iteration of the project, we're adding message queues to tightly corodinate between the parent and the child. 

## How to run: 
I made sure to submit after running 'make clean'. Follow these steps to run: 
Run 'make'. 
Make sure you include the arguments needed. For example: ./oss -n 6 -s 2 -t 100 -i 39999 -f logfile.txt 


## Problems During Testing:
The PCB table endlessly loops on. The logfile it writes into is very very lengthy as well.
